# Lesson Overview: Structured Data and Files

## Topics
* Mapping structured data to file formats
* Reading and writing data to:
    * CSV files
    * XML files
    * JSON files

## Assessments
* Code katas
    * Write Motorcycle class data to CSV format manually (no library)
    * Map existing file data to objects (JSON and XML)
    * Map existing objects to file data (JSON and XML)

* Data ideas:
    * TV shows
    * Actors/actresses
    * Planets and their stats
    * NFL players
    * Movies
    * Dogs
    * Airplanes
    * Computer monitors
    * Laptops
    * Cars

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE
* OpenCSV 1.8
* Jackson Databind 2.8.10 
* Jackson Data Format XML 2.8.10

## Approach
We begin this lesson by having learners think through the steps needed to create objects from data in a CSV file. We then write the code (as a group) to implement this. 

After learners understand the basics of mapping file data to objects, we discuss the things that could go wrong with the code that we wrote. This will lead to the realization that this is a difficult and complex task. 

Next, we introduce CSV, JSON, and XML libraries that take these difficultes into account. We show how to use these libraries in fairly simple scenarios and then have learners practice in pairs.

## Assumptions
* This lesson builds on ideas previously presented by exploring how to store the data contained in objects to various file formats and how to create objects from the data stored in files.
