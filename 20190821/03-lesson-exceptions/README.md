# Lesson Overview: Exceptions

## Topics

    * Try
    * Catch
    * Finally

## Assessments

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE 

## Approach
So far, we've only worried about code paths that result in no errors. When errors have occured, we've just let things blow up. Obviously, this is not an option for production code—we need to know how to handle error conditions gracefully. The way we do that in Java is to catch and handle exceptions. 

In this lesson, we look at the types of exceptions in Java and the mechanics of how to handles errors when they occur. These skills will come in handy in the next lesson when we start to do some more extensive file I/O.

## Assumptions
* We talked briefly about exceptions when we introduced simple file I/O using the Scanner.
* At that point, we talked about the "Catch or Specify" requirement for handling exception in Java, but we only looked at the Specify portion of the requirement.
