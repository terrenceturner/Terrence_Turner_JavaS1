1. Look at the first set of nested loops ("CN"). Which variable changes faster?
Is it the variable controlled by the outer loop (c) or the variable controlled by the inner loop (n)? Answer in a comment.

Variable n changes faster because it is nested inside the outer loop. Variable c can not increase until n has reached the
termination point in the loop


2. Change the order of the loops so that the "c" loop is on the inside and the "n" loop is on the outside. How does the output change?

Variable c changes faster. Variable n can not increase until variable c reaches the termination point int the loop

3. Look at the second set of nested loops ("AB"). Change the print() statement to println(). How does the output change? (Then change it back to print().)

It prints out the output on a new line

4. Add a System.out.println() statement after the close brace of the inner loop (the "b" loop), but still inside the outer loop. How does the output change?

Variable b will be unreachable because it will outside of the coding block
