## Approach
We take a bottom up approach to learning Java. The material starts with the non-object oriented features of the language and gets learners writing simple programs as early as possible. We want them to learn step-wise problem solving and basic logic first. We move from variables, to flow of control, to methods, and then finally to objects. We encourage learners to be verbose and explicit in their code at first so they understand everything that is going on. As they get more comfortable with the language, we introduce and encourage more concise code. We want learners to focus on the fundamentals so they build a solid foundation and develop good, intentional habits. 

## Assumptions
- Familiarity with the concepts of the JDK and JRE
- Familiarity with IntelliJ IDEA
- Familiarity with Maven
- Ability to create a simple Maven based project with IntelliJ
