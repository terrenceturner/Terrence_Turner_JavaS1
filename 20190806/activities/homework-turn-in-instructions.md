1. # Homework/Summative Assessment Submission Instructions
   ## One Time Setup Steps
   1. Clone the class git repository to your desktop. 
       * The link for the class repository can be found here: <insert URL for class repository>
   2. In your personal Github account, create a repository called: YourFirstName_YourLastName_JavaS1
       * Be sure to set this repository as **private**
       * Add your instructional staff as collaborators to this repository.
   3. Clone this newly created repository to your desktop. 
   4. Also on your desktop, create a folder called 'Working Folder JavaS1'. 
   ## Steps for Homework Submissions
   1. In your **class Git repository**, execute ```git pull origin master``` to pull down the latest assignments and class materials.
   2. Inside the folder called 'Working Folder JavaS1' **create** a folder called YYYYMMDD where YYYYMMDD = the year/month/day that the assignment is **due**.
   3. **Copy** the new assignments folder from your **class** git repository to the YYYYMMDD folder you just created.
   4. Work on and complete your assignments in that folder.  The folder may contain multiple IntelliJ projects - **open each project folder separately in IntelliJ**.  Remember that you can identify an IntelliJ project folder because it contains a ```pom.xml``` file. Find the ```pom.xml``` file and open the **parent folder of the pom file**.
   6. When you have completed your assignments, **COPY** your completed YYYYMMDD folder (located inside in your **Working Folder JavaS1**) into your personal Github repository folder located on your desktop.
   7. Once the YYYYMMDD folder has been copied into your Github repository, navigate into your Github repository in either your Terminal (Mac) or Gitbash (Windows).  Once you have navigated to the appropriate repository, complete the following commands (which should be familiar if you have completed your Prework):
      1. ```git add -A```
      2. ```git commit -m "< commit message >"``` where < commit message > is your commit message for the commit.
      3. ```git push origin master```

   8. Open your personal account on Github.com. Navigate to the YourFirstName_YourLastName_JavaS1 repository. 
   9. Click on the YYYYMMDD folder that you created and uploaded for the current set of assignments. Confirm that ALL of the expected projects have been included inside that folder. Again, the folder name should be the **submission date** of the assignment. 
   10. **Copy the URL** of the YYYYMMDD folder inside your Github repository from the browser address bar.
   10. Log into Boot Camp Spot and paste the URL in for this specific assignment in the appropriate location. 
   ## Steps for Summative Assessment Submissions
   1. In your **class Git repository**, execute ```git pull origin master``` to pull down the latest instructions for the Summative Assessment.
   2. Inside the folder called 'Working Folder JavaS1' create a folder called **U?-M?-Summative-Lastname-Firstname** where U?-M? are the Unit number and Module number associated with the Summative Assessment. 
   3. **Copy** the new summative instructions from your **class** git repository folder to the **U?-M?-Summative-Lastname-Firstname** folder you just created.
   4. Work on and complete your Summative Assessment in that folder. The folder may contain multiple IntelliJ projects - **open each project folder separately in IntelliJ**.  Remember that you can identify an IntelliJ project folder because it contains a ```pom.xml``` file. Find the ```pom.xml``` file and open the **parent folder of the pom file** in order to properly open the project. 
   6. When you have completed your Summative Assessment, **COPY** your completed **U?-M?-Summative-Lastname-Firstname** folder (located inside in your **Working Folder- JavaS1**) into your personal Github repository folder located on your desktop.
   7. Once the **U?-M?-Summative-Lastname-Firstname** folder has been copied into the Github repository folder, navigate into your Github repository in either your Terminal (Mac) or Gitbash (Windows).  Once you have navigated to the appropriate repository, complete the following commands (which should be familiar if you have completed your Prework):
      1. ```git add -A```
      2. ```git commit -m "< commit message >"``` where < commit message > is your commit message for the commit.
      3. ```git push origin master```

   8. Open your personal account on Github.com. Navigate to the YourFirstName_YourLastName_JavaS1 repository. 
   9. Click on the **U?-M?-Summative-Lastname-Firstname** folder that you created and uploaded. Confirm that ALL of the expected projects have been included inside that folder. Again, the folder name should be related to the Unit and Module associated with the Summative Assessment. 
   10. **Copy the URL** of the Summative Assessment folder from the browser address bar.
   11. Log into Boot Camp Spot and paste the URL in for this specific Summative in the appropriate location.
