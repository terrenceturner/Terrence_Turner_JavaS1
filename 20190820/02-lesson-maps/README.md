# Lesson Overview: Maps

## Topics
* N/A

## Assessments
* Largest cities
* Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE 

## Approach
This lesson picks up where the previous lesson left off. All of the foundational knowledge about iterators, generics, wrapper classes, and references applies to maps just as it applies to lists. 

We take an approach similar to the previous lesson where we show the functionality of the Map interface a bit at a time and have the learners practice as we go.

## Assumptions
* We covered the collections framework, iterators, generics, and wrapper classes in the previous lesson.
* These topics prepared the learners to understand and use the List interface and the ArrayList class.
