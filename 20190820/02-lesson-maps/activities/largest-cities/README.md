# Largest Cities

## Specification

Your program must do the following:

1. Create a class called `com.company.City` with the following properties:
    a. `name`
    b. `population`
1. Create `com.company.City` variables to hold the below data.

        |       com.company.City      |    Population     |
        |-----------------|-------------------|
        | New York        |      8654321      |
        | Los Angeles     |      4563218      |
        | Chicago         |      2716520      |
        | Denver          |       704621      |
        | Des Moines      |       217521      |
        | Atlanta         |       486213      |

1. Create a Map that holds the names of states and their corresponding com.company.City objects (State name is the `key`, com.company.City object is the `value`)
1. Prints the `name` and `population` for each com.company.City along with its corresponding state name to the screen
1. Prints the states with cities that have a population over a given value (this value is typed in by the user of the program) to the screen 

_Hint_: You will have to add code to ask the user for a minimum population. Once you have this value, go through each state/city pair as you did for #4 above but only print the information for cities that have a population above the limit
