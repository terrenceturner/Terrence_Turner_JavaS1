# Lesson Overview: Collections

## Topics
* Collections
* Iterators
* Generics
* Lists

## Assessments
* Code katas (list manipulation and iteration)

## Required Software and Resources
 * Java
 * IDE

## Approach
This lesson brings together many of the concepts that we've covered so far and shows them in action. We see interfaces and interitance used in the collections framework. We learn how reference types work and what that means for storing object references in data structures. 

We also cover new topics, such as generic types, iterators, and wrapper classes. Understanding these is critical to being able to make good design and engineering decisions when developing code. Much of the information covered in this lesson is fodder for interview/evaluation questions (for example, the purpose of wrapper classes and autoboxing/unboxing of primitive types). 

It is important to make sure that learners understand what is going on behind the scenes when we use collections. They should also be able to do basic operations with lists. Though the syntax used in these operations is pretty straighforward, everything going on behind the scenes is pretty complex—and learners need a solid grasp on both. 

We take a top-down approach, covering topics in the following order:
1. Java collections framework and its overall purpose
1. Iterators and visiting all of the items in a collection
1. Java generics and how they are used with collections
1. Wrapper classes, autoboxing, and unboxing
1. Lists, how they fit into the collections framework, and how they are used

## Assumptions
* Knowledge of basic Java syntax.
