# Lesson Overview: Arrays

## Topics
-	The concept of a data structure
-	Array overview
-	Array declaration
-	Array initialization
-	Array manipulation
-	Two-dimensional arrays

## Assessments
- Coding Katas

## Required Software and Resources
- Java
- IDE

## Approach
We relate arrays to single variables, noting their similarities (single type, you must declare them, you must initialize them) and their differences (arrays can have more than one value, indexes, different way of declaration and assignments, etc.). We demonstrate how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays and then have learners practice on their own.

## Assumptions
- Understanding of variable declaration
- Understanding of variable assignment
- Understanding of Java primitive types
