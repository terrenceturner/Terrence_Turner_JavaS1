# States and Cities Design and Build Activity

In this activity you will design and build a simple application based on the specification below. This specification is intentionally vague, this exercise is meant to force you to think about the design of the application and to ask good questions about the requirements.

## Requirements

1. This application must keep track of state information
1. It must track the following data about states:
    1. Name
    1. Population
    1. Cities
        1. It must track the following data about each city in a state:
            1. Name
            1. Population
            1. Whether or not it is the capital
1. The application must allow the user to do the following:
    1. Add states
    1. Delete states
    1. List all states
    1. Add a city to a state
    1. Delete a city from a state
    1. List all the cities for a state
    1. Search for states by name
    1. Search for states less than or greater than a certain population
    1. Search for cities by name for a state
    1. List the capital of a state
    1. Search for cities less than or greater than a certain population for a state
1. The user interface for this application must be the command line
1. The initial version of this application must store all data in memory, a later version must persist the data to file using one of the techniques shown in class

You are to use Collections, Lists, Maps, lambdas, streams and everything else you've learned thus far in the course to solve this problem.
