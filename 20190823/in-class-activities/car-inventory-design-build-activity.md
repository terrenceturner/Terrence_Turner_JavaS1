# Car Inventory Design and Build Activity

In this activity you will design and build a simple application based on the specification below. This specification is intentionally vague, this exercise is meant to force you to think about the design of the application and to ask good questions about the requirements.

## Requirements

1. This application must keep track of an inventory of cars.
1. It must track the following data about the cars in inventory:
    1. Make
    1. Model
    1. Year
    1. Color
    1. Miles on the odometer
1. The application must allow the user to do the following:
    1. Add a car to inventory
    1. Delete a car from inventory
    1. List all the cars in inventory
    1. Search for cars by:
        1. Make
        1. Model
        1. Year
        1. Color
        1. Less than a certain number of miles
1. The user interface for this application must be the command line
1. The initial version of this application must store all data in memory, a later version must persist the data to file using one of the techniques shown in class

You are to use Collections, Lists, Maps, lambdas, streams and everything else you've learned thus far in the course to solve this problem.
