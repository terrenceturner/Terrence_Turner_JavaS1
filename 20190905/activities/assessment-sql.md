# SQL Queries

In this assessment you will create SQL queries to answer various questions and manipulate data in two example databases.

## Structure
Your solution must have the following structural elements:

* All of your SQL queries must be in a file called ```assessment-sql-firstname-lastname.sql```
* Include the question you are answering in a SQL comment above each of your SQL queries.

## Methodology

All of your queries will be run against either the northwind or car_lot databases. Your instructor will assist everyone in setting these database up before everyone begins the assignment. This involves running three SLQ scripts against your MySQL database. These are all found in the starter-code folder of this lesson.

1. northwind_schema.sql
1. northwind_data.sql
1. car_lot_schema.sql

These scripts must be successfully executed before you can begin this assignment.

Develop and test all of your SQL queries in MySQL Workbench. Once a query is working, copy it into your ```assessment-sql-firstname-lastname.sql``` file that you will turn in.
