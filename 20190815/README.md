## Approach
This lesson is the first of three in which we talk about interfaces, composition, and inheritance. We frame these as ways to express relationships between objects. 

We lead with interfaces because, of the three, they are the most used in enterprise development. We follow with composition because we believe in favoring composition over inheritance where appropriate. Finally, we cover inheritance. Although we generally favor composition over inheritance, the use of one over the other really comes down to the type of relationship you are trying to model. In the end, we believe in the right tool for the right job.

We talk about interfaces from two directions:
* As a contract-like mechanism
* As a way to promote/gain interopereability without specifying anything about the implementation details

We start with some examples of similar things from the real world and then dive into the syntax and mechanics of interfaces.

## Assumptions
* So far, we have talked about classes as standalone things.
