# Lesson Overview: Controlling Program Flow

## Topics

- Boolean expressions
- Conditional execution
- Loops
- Random numbers

## Assessments

- Hi-Lo
- How Many Times to 7?
- FizzBuzz
- Loan Calculator
- Prime Finder
- Katas
    - Conditionals
    - Loops
    - Range Checking

## Required Software and Resources

- Java JDK
- IDE

## Approach
We start with boolean expressions, which are key components in conditional statements and loops. We demonstrate how boolean expressions are used in conditionals (both ifs and switches) and then move on to loops (for, while, do/while). 

We show syntax examples along with some examples of these constructs in action. Learners then work on several labs and katas to explore how these features work.

## Assumptions
- Understanding of variables, statements, and expressions.
- Abiity to create a Maven based Java program using IntelliJ IDEA.
