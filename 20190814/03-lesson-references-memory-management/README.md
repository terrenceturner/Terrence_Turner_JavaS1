# Lesson Overview: References, Storage, and Memory Management

## Topics
* The ```new``` keyword
* Creating and using objects
* References and storage
* Garbage collection
* Pass by value / pass by reference

## Assessments
*	Simple calculator
*	Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE

## Approach
The approach in this lesson is a mix between practical and theoretical. We start by discussing how to instantiate objects and use them in a program. This reinforces concepts from the previous lesson—specifically, constructors and the dot operator. This also gives a more detailed look at how the ```new``` operator works with constructors. Up until now, learners have been blindly following the instantiation pattern that we showed them so they could use the Scanner.
 
Next, we look into how the JVM manages the memory associated with new objects and variables in a program. We step through some code and talk about what is happening in memory as the code executes. It is important for learners to understand how the JVM manages memory so they can make intelligent design decisions and write efficient code. 

Finally, we look at how Java passes parameters into methods and discuss the differences between pass by value and pass by reference. Again, it is important for learners to have a firm grasp on these concepts so they understand how their code will behave.

## Assumptions
* The previous lesson concentrated on the structure of a class and how one is put together.
* The previous lesson was about classes "on paper."
