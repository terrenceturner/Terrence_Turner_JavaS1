# Lesson Overview: Class Design

## Topics
* Cohesion
* Composition
* Single responsibility principle
* Method overloading

## Assessments
* Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE

## Approach
We want this lesson to be the continuation of the story we've been telling about classes: classes are great organizational tools that allow us to have more fine-grained control over how we write code and how other parts of a program can use that code.

We start by reviewing two tenets of effective class design: cohesion and the single responsibility principle.  

Then we move on to method overloading and its benefits. Learners have already been using classes with overloaded methods (like ```System.println(...```); this lesson explains how that works.

## Assumptions
* The previous lesson dug into the components of a Java class, how we instantiate Java classes, and how the JVM manages memory as we use objects.
* That lesson also explored how we use objects in our programs after they have been instantiated.
