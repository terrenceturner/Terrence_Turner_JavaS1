*	The ```static``` keyword
*	Dot operator

## Assessments
*	Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE

## Approach

We start by treating the class as a container for properties and methods. We'll fit classes and objects into the greater OOP landscape in later lessons—for now, we'll concentrate on the pieces and parts of a class.  

We cover the difference between classes and objects, constructors and the ```new``` keyword, getters and setters, and methods. After learners have seen the structure and mechanics of classes, we talk about the ```this``` and ```static``` keywords and the dot operators. 

The activities concentrate on having the learners model items, implement them as classes, and discuss the modeling choices they made.

## Assumptions

* The previous lesson presented object-oriented concepts in a non-Java-specific way.
* Many of the examples used real-world examples (such as ATMs).
* The purpose of that lesson was to give the learner a mental model for OOP concepts.
