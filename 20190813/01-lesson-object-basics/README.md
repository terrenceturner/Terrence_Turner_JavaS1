## Approach
This lesson introduces the object-oriented programming (OOP) aspects of Java. We start out by discussing that when writing a program to solve a real-world problem, a developer must map the problem to the worldview of the programming language. To do this, they use abstractions and metaphors to strip the problem down to its essence. 

We then discuss how both the real world (to a large extent) and Java are object-oriented. Learners practice this concept by completing several in-class modeling exercises.

We review the concepts and characteristics of OOP that are universal to all object-oriented languages. We finish by introducing the relationship between classes and types, and the idea of a class's public interface and private implementation.


## Assumptions

Learners will have only seen the non-OOP parts of Java (essentially, they know how to write simple C programs in Java).
