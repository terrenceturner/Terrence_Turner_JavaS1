## Module Overview: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
This module introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. 

Topics include:

- Classes and objects
- References and memory management
- Class design
- Interfaces
- Composition
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## How This Relates to Previous Lessons
Previous lessons taught learners about the non-object-oriented (OO) parts of Java. In essence, we taught them C syntax but deferred any discussion of objects. In this module, we introduce OOP concepts and how they are implemented in Java.


## Approach
We start by defining the high-level characteristics of an OOP language. This gives learners scaffolding for the more detailed information that is covered later. 

Then we introduce models and abstraction to help learners understand how to see the world through an object-oriented lens. In short, we write programs to solve real-world problems using a computer—which works out pretty well because the world is largely object-based. This requires that we first understand the essence of the problem and then map that to Java objects and code. 

The process of mapping the real world to Java objects can be tricky at first, so we give learners the opportunity to model objects in programs like a flight simulator, blueprint renderer, and factory automation system. 

Then we look at how objects are implemented in Java, including the ```new``` keyword, constructors, references, and memory management. Students practice writing classes and instantiating objects, and using those objects in simple programs.

Finally, we talk about interface, composition, and inheritance. These tools help us express relationships among objects and that give us fine-grained control over how the classes we write are used by other code.
