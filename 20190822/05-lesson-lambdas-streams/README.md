# Lesson Overview: Lambdas and Streams

## Topics
* Lambdas
* Aggregate operations
* Pipelines and streams
* Using lambdas and aggregate operations

## Assessments
* Kata: Television
* Coding Bat
* PBDs

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE
* Jackson Databind 2.8.10 
* Jackson Data Format XML 2.8.10 

## Approach
We take a practical approach to learning about streams, aggregate operations, and lambdas. 

We start with aggregate operations, pipelines, and streams and learn how to use these tools to efficiently process objects in a collection. We compare this to the old way of processing objects in a collection using loops. 

Then we introduce lambdas and look at their syntax. Finally, we put it all together in an example that processes the Motorcyle objects introduced in the previous lesson.

## Assumptions
* We covered persisting structured data to various file formats in the last lesson. This gave us a mechanism to store and load fairly large amounts of data in our programs.
