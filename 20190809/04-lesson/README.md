# Lesson Overview: Debugging

## Topics
-	Executing a program in debug mode
-	Setting breakpoints
-	Stepping through programs
-	Observing program values while debugging

## Assessments
- Katas: Debugging practice exercises

## Required Software and Resources
- Java
- IDE

## Approach
We take a pretty hands-on approach with this lesson. The only way to get comfortable with the debugger is to use it. We do some live demonstrations in class and then have learners practice with various scenarios. We introduce the debugger fairly early in order to encourage learners to use it from the beginning. Many beginner programmers shy away from this powerful and useful tool. We don't want that to be the case with anyone in our classes.

## Assumptions
- Ability to create a Maven based Java program with IntelliJ
- Familiarity with variables, statements, and expressions
- Familiarity with boolean expressions, conditionals, and loops
