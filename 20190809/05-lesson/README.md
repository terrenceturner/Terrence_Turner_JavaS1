# Lesson Overview: Methods

## Topics
- Method purpose
- Method signature
- Return types
- Different method forms
- Scoping
- Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) concept
- Intro to the static keyword

## Assessments
- Coding Katas
    - Level 1: Method shell and test code are supplied; participants must implement logic.
    - Level 2: Method signature and test code are supplied; participants must declare method and implement logic.
    - Level 3: Method purpose and parameters are described; participants must declare and implement method and write test code (test cases are described).

    **NOTE**: All test code is in `main`.

## Required Software and Resources
- Java
- IDE

## Approach
We approach methods as a tool to allow developers to better organize and reuse blocks of code. Historically, this is a topic that trips up a good number of learners. For this reason we give several different mental models for methods with the hope that one or more resontate with each learner. We need to make sure we let learners know that they should use the metaphors they find useful and discard the ones they don't. Learning about methods consists of two parts: the syntactical/mechanical part and the mental model. We need to make sure that both parts are coming along for learners. Just because someone seems to get the syntax doesn't mean that they get the underlying concepts.

## Assumptions
- Ability to create Maven based Java programs using IntelliJ
- Understanding of variables, statements, and expressions
- Understanding of boolean expressions, conditionals, and loops
